 - No tabs are used. Indent size is 2 spaces.

 - protected, private and public keywords are only indented 1 space.

 - namespaces do not increase indentation:
namespace bar{
Class C {};
}

- comments are not wrapped. Best use a line-wrapping IDE

- camelCase is being used. Acronyms may have, at most, their first letter capitalised:
 variableName		not VariableName
 constName
 somethingOglRelated	not somethingOGLRelated
 oglRelatedVariable	not OglRelatedVariable

- enum members are named like variables

- classes, structs and custom types have their first letter capitalised. 
  Class instances follow general variable naming.
 Class ClassName {}; ClassName className;

- do typedef oft-used very long types:
 typedef std::vector< std::string > StringVect;

- In the above example: be aware that C++ relational syntax is inverse from English. 
  C++ syntax maps to English prepositional syntax: 
 vector< string > is a 'vector of strings' or a 'string vector'.

- all filenames start lowercase: ClassName resides in className.h and className.cpp

- member data in classes (but not in structs) start with m_ :
Class A {
 protected:
  float m_value;

 public:
  A();
  float getValue();
};

- static constants in classes start with k_.

- name conventions are overriden by mathematical standardised conventions. 
  For instance, the gravitational constant G will be k_G, not k_g.

- Well-known names for certain variables and constants are _more precise_ than long names.
  Thus, k_G is a better name than k_gravitationalConstant, due to its widespread use in physics.

- try to separate public, protected and private blocks inside a class definition with an empty line (as above).
  Inside such blocks, separate data and functions with an empty line.

- Code blocks are delimited like 1TS, with 1 space before { :
 for(;;) {	not	for(;;)		nor 	for(;;){
 }			{			}
			}

- function blocks are delimited the same way:
 void foo() {
 }

- relatively small structs which are being used exclusively by or together with 
  the classes using them are declared inside that class. 
  If relatively small, struct member functions can also reside in the .h file.

- one- and two-liner member functions can reside in the .h file. 
  If entirely not surprising, their code can be on the same line as the definition:
 float getValue() { return m_value; }
 void setValue(float value) { m_value = value; updateSecondaryValues(); }

- do try to comment your code. Do try to have explicit names for variables. 

- do try to use enums instead of numbers.

- unary operators are not space-separated from their operands. 
  Binary operators are (except hierachical operators, like :: . and ->).
 if(!val) 		not if ( !val )		nor if(! val)
 w = u * v;		not w=u*v;
 a = avg(v1, v2);	not a = avg(v1,v2);
 A::a->f().b()		not A :: a -> f() . b()

- if putting space in templates, have the spacing for both angular parantheses:
 vector< vector<bool> >		not vector<vector<bool> >	nor vector<vector<bool>>
 preferably not  vector< vector< bool > >

- spacing << and >> during cout is entirely dependant on the readability of the code. In general:
cout<<"a: "<<5;
is entirely readable and ok. (the shape of the << and >> operators often provides separation enough). 

- using () to make operator order apparent is generally a good idea. 
  If there would be too many parens, then probably it would be better to split the expression in pieces.

- do not "using namespace" in .h files. Do use it in .cpp files, to make the code more readable.

- place structure in .h files. Place logic in .cpp files.
